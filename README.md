# Web Scraping Project

This project is a demonstration of web scraping, specifically focusing on extracting content from web pages based on HTML tags. The provided code showcases how to retrieve and parse HTML content using Python and the BeautifulSoup library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

Install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `scraper.py` file in a text editor.

4. Modify the `url` variable with the URL of the webpage you want to scrape.

5. Modify the HTML tags used in the code to match the specific content you wish to extract.

6. Run the script using the following command:


python scraping.py



The script will send a GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content, and extract the desired information based on the specified HTML tags.

7. The extracted content will be displayed in the console output.

8. The extracted titles can be saved to an Excel file by uncommenting and modifying the relevant code in `scraper.py`. By default, it will save the titles to a file named `titles.csv`. Adjust the code to match your requirements.

## Customization

To customize the scraping process for different web pages, consider the following modifications:

- **URL**: Change the `url` variable in the `scraper.py` file to the desired webpage URL.

- **HTML Tags**: Update the HTML tags in the code to match the specific elements you want to extract. Use the `find_all()` method to locate elements based on their HTML tags, and the `get()` or `text` methods to retrieve specific attributes or text content.

- **Data Processing**: Extend the code to further process or store the extracted data as per your project requirements. For example, you can save the data to a CSV file, perform additional analysis, or integrate it into a larger application.
